	abstract = {Abstract. Version 1.1 of the editorial of Geoscientific Model Development (GMD),
published in 2015 (GMD Executive Editors, 2015), introduced clarifications to the policy on publication
of source code and input data for papers published in the journal. Three
years of working with this policy has revealed that it is necessary
to be more precise in the requirements of the policy and in the narrowness of
its exceptions. Furthermore, the previous policy was not specific in the
requirements for suitable archival locations. Best practice in code and
data archiving continues to develop and is far from universal among scientists. This has
resulted in many manuscripts requiring improvement in code
and data availability practice during the peer-review process. New
researchers continually start their professional lives, and it remains the case
that not all authors fully appreciate why code and data publication
is necessary. This editorial provides an opportunity to explain this in the context of GMD. The changes in the code and data policy are summarised as follows:
 The requirement for authors to publish source code, unless this
is impossible for reasons beyond their control, is clarified. The
minimum requirements are strengthened such that all model code must
be made accessible during the review process to the editor and to
potentially anonymous reviewers. Source code that can be made public
must be made public, and embargoes are not permitted. Identical
requirements exist for input data and model evaluation data sets in
the model experiment descriptions. The scope of the code and data required to be published is
described. In accordance with Copernicus' own data policy, we now
specifically strongly encourage all code and data used in any
analyses be made available. This will have particular relevance
for some model evaluation papers where editors may now strongly
request this material be made available. The requirements of suitable archival locations are specified, along
with the recommendation that Zenodo is often a good choice.
In addition, since the last editorial, an “Author contributions”
section must now be included in all manuscripts.},

            Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the largest source of uncertainty in global radiative forcing estimates, hampering our understanding of climate evolution. Recent empirical evidence suggests surface tension depression by organic aerosol to significantly influence the formation of cloud droplets, and hence cloud optical properties. In climate models, however, surface tension of water is generally assumed when predicting cloud droplet concentrations. Here we show that the sensitivity of cloud microphysics, optical properties and shortwave radiative effects to the surface phase are dictated by an interplay between the aerosol particle size distribution, composition, water availability and atmospheric dynamics. We demonstrate that accounting for the surface phase becomes essential in clean environments in which ultrafine particle sources are present. Through detailed sensitivity analysis, quantitative constraints on the key drivers – aerosol particle number concentrations, organic fraction and fixed updraft velocity – are derived for instances of significant cloud microphysical susceptibilities to the surface phase.},

            This paper introduces the Kinematic Driver Model (KiD) and its application. KiD is a 1D modelling framework developed at the UK Met Office to facilitate a consistent intercomparison of the microphysics parametrizations employed in a number of cloud‐resolving models and numerical weather prediction models. The development of the KiD model was born out of GCSS intercomparison results, which show a wide range of microphysical behaviour and a need to explain the behaviour of different microphysics schemes without the complication of dynamic or radiative feedbacks. This paper describes the KiD model and one of the standard test cases for warm microphysics. Results from a comparison of warm microphysics schemes are presented. The schemes tested produce very different surface precipitation rates and onset timings, as well as different accumulated precipitation. In general, single‐moment bulk schemes produce the most rapid onset of precipitation and the widest range in accumulated surface precipitation. Sensitivity tests within the KiD show that including a diagnostic intercept parameter for the rain size distribution reduced variation between the single‐moment schemes. However, the early onset of precipitation is a persistent feature of single‐moment schemes. Double‐moment bulk schemes exhibit improved timing for the precipitation onset relative to an explicit bin model and comparison of accumulated precipitation shows much better agreement. However, double‐moment schemes tend to produce relatively large peak precipitation rates, particularly with the deeper cloud. Further sensitivity tests within the KiD demonstrate that using a three‐moment scheme, with variable shape parameter, significantly improves the simulation peak precipitation rate relative to an explicit bin model. The tests and results presented in this paper are described to act as a reference for other users to compare with their microphysics schemes and aid microphysics parametrization development.

              A novel, particle‐based, probabilistic approach for the simulation of cloud microphysics is proposed, which is named the super‐droplet method (SDM). This method enables the accurate simulation of cloud microphysics with a less demanding cost in computation. SDM is applied to a warm‐cloud system, which incorporates sedimentation, condensation/evaporation and stochastic coalescence. The methodology to couple super‐droplets and a non‐hydrostatic model is also developed. It is confirmed that the result of our Monte Carlo scheme for the stochastic coalescence of super‐droplets agrees fairly well with the solutions of the stochastic coalescence equation. The behaviour of the model is evaluated using a simple test problem, that of a shallow maritime cumulus formation initiated by a warm bubble. Possible extensions of SDM are briefly discussed. A theoretical analysis suggests that the computational cost of SDM becomes lower than the spectral (bin) method when the number of attributes—the variables that identify the state of each super‐droplet—becomes larger than some critical value, which we estimate to be in the range
