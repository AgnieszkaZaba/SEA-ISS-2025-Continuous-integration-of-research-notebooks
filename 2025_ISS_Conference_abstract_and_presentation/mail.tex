Do I understand correctly that all measurements were carrier out using optical spectrometers working with vapour - either ambient vapor or vapourised hydrometeors?

Despite focus on sub- and supersaturated conditions, the reference color curves

We understand that the color curves are in equilibrium (ice and water), dashed lines represent sub- and supersaturated conditions (labeled with respect to liquid). Would it be apt to consider the effects of the flow (ventilation coefficient)? Besides saturation curves we will have dependency  number n(ref Horita,  Rożański, Cohen 2008).

Have you considered oxygen isotopes?
